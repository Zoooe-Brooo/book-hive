# Book-Hive

Welcome to Book-Hive, a platform for readers and book lovers where users can post book reviews, analyze sentiment through TensorFlow.js, and interact with the community by sharing their thoughts. This application leverages modern web technologies and the MVC architecture to provide an engaging user experience

## Introduction

The goal of Book-Hive is to provide an interactive platform for readers to post and analyze book reviews. Users can authenticate themselves, submit reviews, and receive real-time feedback on the sentiment of their text through a star-rating system powered by TensorFlow.js.

## :beginner: About

Book-Hive is a collaborative full-stack application designed for book lovers to share and analyze book reviews. The platform enables users to register, log in, post reviews, and use machine learning to analyze the sentiment of those reviews. Built using modern technologies, Book-Hive showcases a seamless interaction between the front end and back end, demonstrating a strong user authentication system, RESTful API, and responsive design.


### Features include:
- User Authentication: Secure sign-up, log-in, and session handling using express-session and bcrypt.
- RESTful API: Robust back-end functionality with Node.js and Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
- Sentiment Analysis: Integration of TensorFlow.js for analyzing user reviews' sentiment and providing feedback via a dynamic star rating system.
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, view, update, and delete their own reviews.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive front-end using Handlebars.js to provide an intuitive user interface on any device.
- Seamless Database Management: PostgreSQL database powered by Sequelize ORM for managing users, books, and reviews.
- Environment Variables: Sensitive information is protected using environment variables (dotenv).

Build

MVC Structure:
- Models: Created using Sequelize ORM to manage database entities like users, books, and reviews.
- Views: Developed using Handlebars.js to dynamically render HTML content.
- Controllers: API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for users and books.

Authentication:
- express-session: For managing user sessions and cookies.
- bcrypt: For securely hashing and storing passwords.

Sentiment Analysis:
- TensorFlow.js: Integrated to analyze the sentiment of user reviews and provide dynamic star ratings.

Database:
- PostgreSQL: Managed with Sequelize ORM for a structured, relational database.
- Sequelize ORM: Enables interaction between the server and the PostgreSQL database using models to perform CRUD operations on data.

Version Control:
- Project is version-controlled with Git, using branches and pull requests for collaborative development.

Environment Setup:
- dotenv: Used to manage environment variables, ensuring sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and session secrets are not hardcoded.

Version Control:
- Project development was tracked using Git, with branches for new features and bug fixes.
- All changes were version-controlled via GitHub with regular commits, pull requests, and reviews to maintain code integrity and team collaboration.

Responsive and Polished UI:
